# VoxCap

## About

VoxCap is a fast-paced VR movement game with floating robot heads, modular antenna caps, and voice-driven facial expressions. It started as a Gorilla Tag clone I was hired to make, but the people who “hired” me never intended to pay up. After putting in days of work, I got kicked out and left with nothing.

So now, this is my project — legally mine, fully rebranded, and way cooler than just a clone. It’s about crazy movement, weird floating robots, and actually having a voice (literally). No more freeloaders, just me doing my thing.

## The Story

I was promised payment to make a whole game. Didn’t get paid. They ghosted me but kept using my work. The guy running it was probably a kid asking for a Gorilla Tag clone with zero regard for copyright.

Now I’m taking it back, scrapping the original map, ditching stolen stuff, and turning it into something fresh — a social VR experience where you can customize your robot’s antenna caps and let your voice control your expressions.

This is the result. No more getting played.
